    """The Bayesian Vector Autoregression model using past observations as 
    regressors in a specified neighbourhood. E.g., if the 4-neighbourhood is
    selected with lag length 1, then the mean of y_{t,i} is modelled as linear
    combination of observations y_{t-1, j} \in nb(i). Around the boundary,
    the neighbourhoods are 0-padded.

    ###****************************************************************###
    Inputs always needed. They correspond to priors in the following model:
            Y ~ N(X*beta, sigma2 * I), 
            beta ~ N(beta_0, sigma2 * V_0), 
            sigma2 ~ IG(a,b)
        
    prior_a: float >0:
        a parameter of the Inverse Gamma, a>0
        
    prior_b: float >0:
        b parameter of the Inverse Gamma, b>0
        
    prior_mean_beta: 1D-numpy array of size k, k = num regressors:
        corresponds to beta_0, i.e. the mean prior of coefficients.
        Takes precedence over prior_mean_scale if both specified.
        
    prior_var_beta: 2D-numpy array of size kxk, k = num regressors:
        corresponds to V_0, i.e. the covariance prior of coefs 
        Takes precedence over prior_var_scale if both specified.
        
    prior_mean_scale: float:
        If prior_mean_beta is None, prior_mean_scale supplied, the number
        of regressors k is calculated automatically and 
        beta_0 = prior_mean_scale * np.ones(k)
    
    prior_var_scale: float >0:
        If prior_var_beta is None, prior_var_scale supplied, the number
        of regressors k is calculated automatically and 
        beta_0 = prior_var_scale * np.identity(k)

    ###                 REGULAR GRID + STRONG PARAM BINDING            ###
    ###****************************************************************###
    Inputs needed when assuming regular grid with strong parameter binding:
        nbh_sequence, restriction_sequence, padding
    
    nbh_sequence: array with integer entries, only needed if data on 
                  regular grid, with strong coupling between effects:
        0, 4, 8   -> specify the sequence ofVAR-nbhs.
                     corresponds to strong parameter coupling on regular
                     grid with no neighbourhood (0), 4-neighbourhood (4), 
                     and 8-neighbourhood (8). I.e. all locations are on
                     a grid defining their nbhs, and share params.
                     (See restriction_sequence for param sharing)
    
    restriction_sequence: array with integer entries, only needed if data 
                   on regular grid, with strong coupling between effects:
        0, 4, 8 -> specify the restriction of nbh_sequence on regular
                    spatial grid with parameter coupling.
                    Regardless of 0,4,8, we always couple across all 
                    LOCATIONS! I.e., params the same across the grid.
                    However, we can vary how much we couple params within
                    each location's nbh: Not at all, i.e. one parameter
                    for each nbh location relative to each location (0), 
                    the 4 inner and the 4 outer (4), and in the case of
                    a 8-nbh, all 8 together (8). See Fig. 2 in the paper
                    for illustration of 4-nbh (red), 8 nbh (red + blue),
                    0 nbh (orange).
                    
                    NOTE: The parameter bindings for the intercepts are
                    again specified via intercept_grouping (see below).
                    They are NOT strongly coupled unless the argument
                    is not specified or is supplied as None.
    
    padding: string: 
        ONLY needed if we specify nbh_sequence and restriction_sequence,
        implying that we are on a regular grid. Then, we need to pad the
        outside of the grid using one of the below options:
        'overall_mean'  -> compute mean across space and fill in
        'row_col_mean'  -> compute row and col means and fill in
        'zero'          -> insert zeros (bias estimation towards 0)
        'leave-out'     -> don't pad at all, and estimate only using
                            locations with full neighbourhood
          
              
    ###****************************************************************###
    ###                 GENERAL NBHS + ANY PARAM BINDING               ###
    ###****************************************************************###  
    Inputs needed when assuming general nbh structures with arbitrary 
    parameter bindings: 
        intercept_grouping, general_nbh_sequence, 
        general_nbh_restriction_sequence , general_nbh_coupling      
                  
    intercept_grouping: GxS1xS2 numpy array of ones or zeros grouping the 
        locations into G groups so that each group shares the intercept.
        Notice that summing over the G-dimension, we would get an S1xS2
        array of only ones. I.e., each location has to be in one of the G
        groups. Extreme cases: G=1 with a single slice of ones => all 
        locations have one shared intercept. G=S1*S2 with each of the G 
        slicescontaining exactly a single 1-entry and only zeros otherwise 
        => each location has individual intercept.
        
    general_nbh_sequence: list of list of lists:
        Gives an nparray of nparrays of nparrays of  
        coordinates/identifiers, i.e. an object like
        [[[2,3,4],[5,6],[7]], [[5,6],[8],[9,10]], ...].
        Here, [2,3,4] would be the 'closest' nbh to the 
        point with spatial coordinate 0, [5,6] the second-
        closest, [7] the third-closest. how far away from
        the closest nbh you consider the data is implied
        by the general_nbh_restriction_sequence that 
        will give you the indices of the nbhs to be 
        considered for each lag length.
        
        In the notation of the PAPER, this gives you the nbh. system as
        [[N_1(1), N_2(1), N_3(1)], [N_1(2), N_2(2), N_2(3)], ...], i.e. 
        list entry s belongs to location with index s and contains n neigh-
        bourhoods N_1(s), ... N_n(s) s.t. the indices describe spatial 
        closeness, with smaller indices indicating that we are closer to s.
        Note that we assume n to be the same for all locations. If there 
        is a case where you assume that some locations s have less nbhs 
        than others, simply add some empty nbhs, i.e. N_i(s) = [].
                                                      
    general_nbh_restriction_sequence: list of list:
        Gives you a list of lists of indices, i.e.
        [[0,1,2,3], [0,1,2], [0],[]], where it must hold that
        later entries are strict subsets of previous ones
        s.t. the largest value at position l is at most as
        big as the largest value at position l-1. Also, if 
        k is the largest value at position l, it must hold
        that all k' s.t. 0<=k'<=k must be in that list entry
        NOTE: If you want to have only auto-regressive 
        terms at some nbh (I.e., only its own past influen-
        ces the present), then simply add an empty list [].
        
        In the notation of the PAPER, this is the function p(.) assigning
        temporal meaning to the neighbourhood structure. p is given in 
        list form so that the l-th entry of p gives all indices that 
        are going to be used at lag length l. I.e., assuming p(l) = 3 
        (using p's definition from the paper), it will hold that the 
        respective entry in general_nbh_restriction_sequence is going to
        be [0,1,2]. More generally, for p(l) = k, [0,1,...,k-1].
        
    general_nbh_coupling: string:
        ["no coupling", "weak coupling", 
        "strong coupling"], tells you how neighbourhoods 
        are tied together. "no coupling" means that each
        linear effect of s' \in N_i(s) is modelled sepa-
        rately. "weak coupling" means that the linear 
        effect for all s' \in N_i(s) are modelled together,
        and "strong coupling" means that the linear effects
        are also modelled together across space, i.e. 
        s' \in N_i(s) and g \in N_i(k) have the same effect
        (but s' in N_j(s) and g in N_i(k) do not)
        NOTE: no coupling is not implemented, because you
        can obtain the same effect by weak coupling and
        treating each station as its own nbh.
        
        In the PAPER, notes on this are right after SSBVAR definition.
        "weak coupling" is the standard modelling framework that assumes
        that for all locations in a given nbh, we have a single linear 
        effect. "strong coupling" means that in addition, we have the same
        linear neighbourhood effect for each location.

    ###                 HYPERPARAMETER LEARNING                        ###
    ###****************************************************************###  
    Inputs needed when doing hyperparameter learning: 
        hyperparameter_optimization [don't use auto_prior_update!] 
                        
    hyperparameter_optimization (ProbabilityModel level): string or None:
        -> [True, False, None, "caron", "online", "turner"]
        by default, this is True, which amounts to updating
        the gradients but not performing on-line/caron's 
        hyperpar. learning. If False or None, the gradients 
        are not updated. "caron" and "online" both employ
        the on-line hyperparameter learning proposed by
        Caron, Doucet, Gottardo (2012). If you don't want
        this, but only want to do Turner's routine, you
        have to do so via an enclosing HyperparameterOptimization 
        object. For this, put hyperparameter_optimization
        to True (default) or "turner".
        
        I.e., "turner", "True" mean that gradients are updated recursively,
        but not used (unless an enclosing HyperparameterOptimization
        object uses them), "caron" and "online" mean that we perform 
        gradient descent updates as in the PAPER. "False" and None mean
        that we don't update the gradients. (barely any computational 
        benefit in so doing)
        
    auto_prior_update: boolean.
        Basically, DON'T set to True. It updates the priors by setting them
        to the posterior expectations at time t. For instance, the beta_0
        prior at time t will be set to
            sum_r{ beta_rt[r,:] * P(r|y_1:t) }.

    ###                EXOGENEOUS/ADDITIONAL PREDICTORS                ###
    ###****************************************************************###  
    NOT IMPLEMENTED!!!!  
    Inputs needed when using additional variables: 
        exo_selection, nbh_sequence_exo      
                         
                            
    NOTE: Intercepts, EXO, and ENDO vars can always ge grouped by the 
          following simple procedure: Suppose you have two groups G1, G2.
          Let's assume you assume the same model in G1, G2 but with diff-
          erent parameterizations. Lets say the params you want are
          a(G1), a(G2), b(G1), b(G2). Then you can just estimate all four
          coefs jointly by having G1 have a column of zeros for the var
          corresponding to a(G2), b(G2) and vice versa.
          
    NOTE: At some point, it may be good to replace the strings indicating
          our neighbourhood structures using integers instead, since
          string-computations are more expensive than integer-computations
          
    exo_selection:
       0,1,2,..     -> gives you a selection vector of length 
                            num_exo_vars allowing you to select which exos
                            you want to regress on Y. The integers are
                            the row index in vector [exo1, exo2, ...] of 
                            regressors available at each location. 
    
    nbh_sequence_exo: #not in the input
        0,4,8           -> gives you the nbh of the lagged exos that are
                            regressors for your problem. Starts at time t
                            (rather than t-1, as for endo sequence)
                            
    ###****************************************************************###
    ###                        OTHER INPUTS                            ###
    ###****************************************************************###  
    None of these inputs are needed, they provide additional functionality
    
    non_spd_alerts: boolean:
        Gives an alert whenever the covariance matrix was not semi-positive
        definite and needed to be converted into an spd-matrix by forcing 
        it via 'nearestPD' or adding a disturbance. 
        
        NOTE: If you experience this a lot, try to rescale your data, i.e.
        normalize it on-line or do something along the same lines.
